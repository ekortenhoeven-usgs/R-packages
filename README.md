# R-packages
Custom packages and functions for R.

These are created principally for use by my research group at the USGS Grand Canyon Monitoring and Research Center, to facilitate common R tasks that I (and others) carry out with some regularity.
Currently, this includes a package for carrying out some basic plotting tasks (plots), and a package for carrying out ordination-related analyses (bugR).

Improvements, additions, and suggestions are welcomed.
